title: "Pinon Park Splash Pad"
description: "The Pinon Park Splash Pad in White Rock is a vibrant community space designed to bring families together during the warm months. Completed in collaboration with Los Alamos County and local artist Abby Feldman, this project was part of a larger Recreation Capital Outlay initiative. Los Alamos Landscaping & More proudly constructed the splash pad, which features a flow-through water system that minimizes maintenance costs while maximizing fun. Located near the Youth Activity Center and White Rock Library, the splash pad offers a safe, refreshing space for children to play while parents relax in shaded areas."
