title: "Pottery Replicas"
description: "The San Ildefonso Pottery Replicas in White Rock are a tribute to the rich pottery traditions of the San Ildefonso Pueblo, whose ancestors once inhabited the Pajarito Plateau. This public art installation features six oversized pottery replicas, each representing a different era in the evolution of San Ildefonso pottery, from ancestral cooking pots to contemporary designs. Initiated by the Los Alamos Art in Public Places Board in 2013, the project was a collaboration between local artists, historians, and community partners, coming to completion in 2016."

about: "Los Alamos Landscaping & More played a crucial role in bringing the San Ildefonso Pottery Replicas project to life by constructing the bases and managing the installation of the pottery replicas. Our team carefully selected and positioned custom-cut sandstone boulders, ensuring each piece provided a stable and aesthetically fitting foundation for the large-scale pottery. With precision and attention to detail, we secured the replicas in place, integrating drainage solutions to protect the artwork from environmental wear. We take pride in having helped create a lasting tribute that blends art, history, and landscape into a visually stunning public display."
