  ## ***Get Ready for a Thriving Spring Garden in Northern New Mexico***


  As February rolls in, the high desert climate of Northern New Mexico begins its slow transition from winterâ€™s grip to the milder days of early spring. While we still experience cold nights and occasional snow, longer daylight hours signal that now is the perfect time to start prepping your garden for a season of vibrant growth.


  Los Alamos and White Rock present unique gardening challengesâ€”high elevation, variable temperatures, and a semi-arid climate. But with the right approach, you can create a thriving landscape filled with hardy perennials, native plants, and resilient vegetable crops.


  Hereâ€™s what you should focus on in February to ensure your garden flourishes in the coming months.


  ## **1. Prune Trees, Shrubs, and Perennials**


  Late winter is the best time to prune many trees, shrubs, and perennials before new growth begins. Pruning removes dead or diseased wood, improves plant structure, and encourages healthier blooms and fruit production.


  ### **Best Practices for Pruning in Northern New Mexico**


  * **Fruit Trees:** If you grow apples, peaches, or plums (which do well in our area), prune them to improve airflow and remove crossing branches. Avoid pruning apricots until summer to reduce disease risk.

  * **Shade & Ornamental Trees:** Prune cottonwood, aspen, and honeylocust trees while they are still dormant. For piÃ±on and juniper trees, focus on removing dead or overcrowded branches to maintain a natural shape.

  * **Shrubs & Perennials:** Trim back Russian sage, desert willow, and butterfly bush to encourage strong spring growth. For lavender and sage, wait until March or April to prevent winter damage.

  ## **2. Prepare Garden Beds for Planting**


  Even though the soil may still be partially frozen in shady areas, now is a great time to get your garden beds ready.


  * **Clear Out Debris:** Remove any fallen leaves, dead plants, and leftover mulch from last season to prevent pests and disease.

  * **Loosen the Soil:** If the ground is workable, lightly aerate it with a fork to improve drainage. Avoid turning over soil too much to preserve beneficial microbes.

  * **Add Organic Matter:** Compost or well-aged manure can be lightly worked into the soil to replenish nutrients before spring planting.

  * **Apply Mulch Sparingly:** Mulching now can help retain moisture, but keep it light to allow the soil to warm up naturally.

  ## **3. Start Cool-Season Vegetables Indoors & Outdoors**


  February is a great time to start certain vegetables indoors, while others can be directly sown outdoors in cold frames or low tunnels.


  ### **What to Start Indoors (Transplant Later)**


  ðŸŒ± Broccoli


  ðŸŒ± Cabbage


  ðŸŒ± Cauliflower


  ðŸŒ± Peppers (they need a long head start)


  ðŸŒ± Tomatoes (start later in February for early May transplanting)


  ### **What You Can Direct Sow Outdoors**


  ðŸ¥¬ Spinach


  ðŸ¥¬ Kale


  ðŸ¥¬ Carrots


  ðŸ¥¬ Radishes


  ðŸ¥¬ Peas


  For best results, plant cool-season crops under a row cover to protect them from sudden cold snaps.

  ## **4. Plan & Plant Native and Drought-Tolerant Perennials**


  Los Alamos and White Rock gardens thrive with native plants that can handle our dry climate, cold winters, and strong sun. February is a great time to plan your landscape and even start planting some perennials if the weather is mild.


  ### **Great Native & Waterwise Perennials for Northern New Mexico**


  * **Penstemon (Beardtongue):** Gorgeous spikes of pink, purple, or red flowers that attract hummingbirds.

  * **Purple Coneflower (Echinacea):** A hardy pollinator favorite that blooms all summer.

  * **Yarrow:** Tough, drought-tolerant, and perfect for filling in garden gaps.

  * **Russian Sage:** A favorite for its long-lasting purple blooms and deer resistance.

  * **Agastache (Hummingbird Mint):** Fragrant, colorful, and highly attractive to pollinators.

  * **Cacti & Succulents:** Opt for claret cup cactus, cholla, or native yucca for an ultra-low-water landscape.

  ## **5. Check Irrigation Systems & Watering Plans**


  With spring around the corner, now is the time to assess your irrigation system.


  * **Inspect Drip Lines:** Check for leaks, cracks, or clogs in your drip irrigation system.

  * **Clean Out Rain Barrels:** If you collect rainwater, make sure barrels are clean and ready for use.

  * **Plan Watering Schedules:** In March and April, gradually increase watering frequency to match the warming temperatures.

  ## **6. Control Weeds Before They Take Over**


  One of the best ways to prevent a weedy mess in spring is to tackle them early.


  * **Remove Winter Weeds:** Dandelions, thistle, and cheatgrass start growing early. Hand-pull weeds before they go to seed.

  * **Apply Pre-Emergent (If Needed):** For gravel pathways and driveways, applying a pre-emergent in late February can prevent weed seeds from sprouting.

  * **Use Mulch or Landscape Fabric:** Mulch helps block weeds while also retaining moisture.

  ## **7. Feed Your Soil & Plants**


  February is the perfect time to give your soil some love by replenishing nutrients.


  * **Apply Compost:** Spread a thin layer of compost around perennials, trees, and shrubs.

  * **Use Organic Fertilizer:** For fruit trees, consider a slow-release fertilizer rich in phosphorus and potassium.

  * **Amend Vegetable Beds:** Add bone meal, kelp meal, or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility.
